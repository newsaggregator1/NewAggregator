            Elon Musk makes offer to buy Twitter

            "Tesla boss Elon Musk has offered to buy Twitter, saying he is the right person to "unlock" the social media platform's "extraordinary potential"."
        </h2>
        <div>
        <pre class="page__p">
            In a surprise announcement, Mr Musk said he would pay $54.20 a share for Twitter, valuing it at about $40bn.

            It recently emerged that Mr Musk was Twitter's biggest shareholder after he built up a large stake in the firm.

            He said that if his offer was not accepted: "I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder".

            Mr Musk also said that if the board of directors at Twitter chose to reject the offer, it would be "utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote".

            "They own the company, not the board of directors,".

            Twitter's share price rose jumped by 5.3% to $48.32 in early trading, before falling back to more than $46.20 later on.

            A filing with the US financial regulator appeared to show text and/or voice messages from Mr Musk to Twitter's board, showing that he had raised the idea at the weekend that the business should go private.

            Mr Musk had been invited to join the board, but Twitter announced on Sunday he had decided against it.
    
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I made an offer <a href="https://t.co/VvreuPMeLu">https://t.co/VvreuPMeLu</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1514564966564651008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 14, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

            In the messages published in the filing, Mr Musk said he was not "playing the back-and-forth game" and said of his offer: "It's a high price and your shareholders will love it."

            He said he would have to sell his shares if the deal did not go through.

            "This is not a threat, it's simply not a good investment without the changes that need to be made," he added.

            Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: "This is a deeply hostile move from Elon Musk who has threatened to 'reconsider' his 9.2% stake in the company if his 100% acquisition offer is rejected."

            In his filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr Musk said he had invested in Twitter because "I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe,

            and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy.

            "However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company."

            He added: "Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it."

            Twitter said its board "will carefully review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company and all Twitter stockholders".

            Mr Musk is the world's richest man, according to Forbes magazine, with a net worth of $219bn mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla. He also leads the aerospace firm SpaceX.

            Raidforums marketplace shut down in global operation
        </h1>
        <img title="fbi-hacking" style="width:80% "src="https://uploads.dailydot.com/2022/04/fbi-seizes-hacking-forum.jpg?auto=compress&fm=pjpg" alt="fbi seize hecking" >

            "An online forum providing criminals with stolen personal data has been taken down, in a global operation which saw its founder arrested."
        </h2>
        <pre class="page__p" >
            Found on the open web rather than the darknet, RaidForums hosted sensitive financial information and "served as a major online marketplace for hackers".

            Its founder and chief administrator Diego Santos Coelho, 21, from Portugal, was arrested in the UK on 31 January.

            The US Department for Justice said he remains in custody pending extradition.

            Separately the National Crime Agency (NCA) reported police had arrested another suspected founder of the site - a 21 year-old from Croydon - at his home in March.

            He has since been released, under investigation, but at the time of his arrest officers seized ¬£5,000 in cash,

            thousands of US dollars and activated a freeze on crypto assets worth more than half a million dollars.

            Criminal marketplace:

            RaidForums launched in 2015 and gained prominence in criminal circles by offering access to high-profile database leaks, which could be used to enable crimes such as fraud.

            According to the threat intelligence firm Recorded Future, the site contained more than 530,000 registered members and was a powerful tool among low to mid-level cyber-criminals.

            The compromised data, which hackers bought and sold, included information stolen from UK companies, some of which related to credit cards, bank accounts, usernames and passwords.

            Investigators found that the forum was operating a membership scheme, where users of the site paid up to 10 euros for access to chatrooms which allowed the exchange of photographs

            and data linked to cyber-crime.

            They suspected that administrators of the website, based in the UK, were helping to manage its membership, as well as laundering payments to the site through a separate - seemingly legitimate - online business.

            International Operation:

            Police from the UK, US, Germany, Sweden, Portugal and Romania were all involved in the dismantling of the online platform.

            Under Operation Tourniquet, the international partners took action to close RaidForums and carried out a number of linked arrests.

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The illegal marketplace <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RaidForums?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RaidForums</a> has been shut down üíª<br><br>Its administrator &amp; two accomplices arrested üöî <br><br>Once again, international <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/lawenforcement?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#lawenforcement</a> cooperation leads to a major success ü§ù and we are just getting started.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StrongerTogether?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#StrongerTogether</a> <a href="https://t.co/gGawRPkimj">pic.twitter.com/gGawRPkimj</a></p>&mdash; EC3 (@EC3Europol) <a href="https://twitter.com/EC3Europol/status/1513866923901083653?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
            "The takedown of this online market for the resale of hacked or stolen data disrupts one of the major ways cyber-criminals profit from the large-scale theft of sensitive personal and financial information," said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite.

            "This is another example of how working with our international law enforcement partners has resulted in the shutdown of a criminal marketplace and the arrest of its administrator."

            The FBI's Steven M D'Antuono said: "The seizure of the RaidForums website, which facilitated the sale of stolen data from millions of people throughout the world, and the charges against the marketplace's administrator, are a testament to the strength of the FBI's international partnerships."

            "Cyber-crime transcends borders, which is why the FBI is committed to working with our partners to bring cyber-criminals to justice - no matter where in the world they live or behind what device they try to hide."

            Special agent Jason Kane, from the US Secret Service, said: "This global investigation signifies the remarkable dedication of the US Secret Service and highlights our partnerships with our foreign law enforcement counterparts essential to disrupting sophisticated networks of cyber-criminals."

            Facial recognition firm faces possible ¬£17m privacy fine
        </h1>
        <img title="facial recognition" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/849E/production/_124105933_gettyimages-1310822232.jpg" >
        <h2 class="page__h2">
            "An Australian firm which claims to have a database of more than 10 billion facial images is facing a potential ¬£17m fine over its handling of personal data in the UK."
        </h2>
        <pre class="page__p">
            The Information Commissioner's Office said it had significant concerns about Clearview AI, whose facial recognition software is used by police forces.

            It has told the firm to stop processing UK personal data and delete any it has.

            Clearview said the regulator's claims were "factually and legally incorrect".

            The company - which has been invited to make representations - said it was considering an appeal and "further action".

            It has already been found to have broken Australian privacy law but is seeking a review of that ruling.

            'Google search for faces'
            Clearview AI's system allows a user - for example, a police officer seeking to identify a suspect - to upload a photo of a face and find matches in a database of billions of images it has collected from the internet and social media.

            The system then provides links to where matching images appeared online.

                * Database firm must remove snaps taken in Australia
                * 
                Legality of collecting faces online challenged
            The firm has promoted its service to police as resembling a "Google search for faces".

            But in a statement, the UK's Information Commissioner said that Clearview's database was likely to include "a substantial number of people from the UK" whose data may have been gathered without people's knowledge.

            The firm's services are understood to have been trialled by a number of UK law enforcement agencies, but that was discontinued and Clearview AI does not have any UK customers.

            The ICO said its "preliminary view" was that the firm appeared to have failed to comply with UK data protection laws by:

                   * Failing to process the information of UK citizens fairly
                   * Failing to have a process in place to stop the data being retained indefinitely
                   * Failing to have a lawful reason for collecting the information
                   * And failing to inform people in the UK about what is happening to their data.
            The UK Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said: "I have significant concerns that personal data was processed in a way that nobody in the UK will have expected.

            "UK data protection legislation does not stop the effective use of technology to fight crime. But to enjoy public trust and confidence in their products, technology providers must ensure people's legal protections are respected and complied with."

            The decision is provisional and the ICO said any representations by Clearview AI will be carefully considered before a final ruling is made in the middle of next year.

            'Best interests of the UK'
            Hoan Ton-That, chief executive of Clearview AI, said: "I am deeply disappointed that the UK Information Commissioner has misinterpreted my technology and intentions.

            "My company and I have acted in the best interests of the UK and their people by assisting law enforcement in solving heinous crimes against children, seniors, and other victims of unscrupulous acts.... We collect only public data from the open internet and comply with all standards of privacy and law."

            There are some signs that big tech companies are growing wary of face recognition.

            Earlier in November, Facebook announced that it would no longer use facial recognition software to identify faces in photographs and videos.

            But online tools, and search engines, using facial recognition technology continue to operate, privacy campaigners warn.
